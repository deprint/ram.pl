Language-RAM

This package provides a library and an interpreter to emulate a basic
"Random Access Machine". This computer model uses an assembler-like syntax
and can be used to test simple algorithms for their complexity.

SYNTAX

There are four data registers (a, i1, i2 and i3), 1 instruction pointer (ip) and
an unlimited (limited to your computer's capabilities, of course) data block s.

imm: Number = \d+(\.\d+)?
reg: Register = a|i1|i2|i3
mem: Value in s from fixed index = s[imm]
mmem: Value in s from calculated index = s[i1|i2|i3 ((+|-) imm)?]

INPUT/OUTPUT/HALT

INPUT (imm|imm..imm): Store arguments in the following memory blocks
OUTPUT (imm|imm..imm): Print values of following indices(after HALT)
HALT: Stop program and print results

ASSIGNMENTS

reg <-- imm
reg <-- mem
a <-- mmem
mem <-- reg
mmem <-- a
reg <-- reg

CONDITIONALS

jump imm: Jump to line imm
if reg (<|<=|=|!=|=>|>) imm then jump imm: Jump to line imm if condition is true

ARITHMETIC

a <-- a (+|-|*|div|mod) (imm|mem|mmem)

INDEX-OPERATIONS

i1 <-- i1 (+|-) imm
i2 <-- i2 (+|-) imm
i3 <-- i3 (+|-) imm

COMMENTS

Everything after "//" is a comment.

COMMAND ADDRESS

By default, a line's address is the line number. Prepend "imm> " to set the
address of a line manually (e.g. "2> a <-- s[0] // Command Address: 2").

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
